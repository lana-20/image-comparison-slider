## Image Comparison Slider

![image1](https://github.com/lana-20/image-comparison-slider/blob/main/readme-img.png)

In this project, I have created a slider that compares two images by dragging a bar.
Using vanilla JavaScript, with no framework, library or jquery.
An apt and handy solution for comparing the before and after images from a picture edit or product shot.
